# Binary tree
Binary tree is a tree data structure where every node in a binary tree has 0 to 2 children.

There are two ways to represent binary tree in memory:\
(1) array ([see heap data stucture](./DS_Heap.md))\
(2) linked list (with `left` child node and `right` child node)

### Types of binary tree
#### Full binary tree: 
every node has 0 or 2 children.

#### Complete binary tree: 
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

#### Balanced binary tree (aka AVL tree)
For each node, the height difference of the left and right subtree of the node is not more than 1

### Ways to traverse a tree
####  Breadth-first search (BFS)
- visits all nodes level by level
- BFS is implemented  using queue and can only be traversed in iterative approach

#### Depth-first search (DFS)
- explores each branch until reaching the leaf node then backtracking to next branch
- the traversal can be done in three types of orders:\
(a) **Inorder**, traverse from the **left** subtree to the **root** then to the **right** subtree.\
(b) **Preorder**, traverse from the **root** to the **left** subtree then to the **right** subtree.\
(c) **Post order**, traverse from the **left** subtree to the **right** subtree then to the **root**.

- DFS is implemented using stack. Hence, the traversal of tree can be done in:\
(a) recursive approach \
(b) iterative approach
